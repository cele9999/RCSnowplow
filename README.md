# RCSnowplow
The SnowByte is an Open-Source Remote Controlled (RC) Snowplow that can help in clearing or removing snow from your driveway. Its a bare-bones RC vehicle that can be modified or customized using its code and supporting documentation. My goal was to put together a simple open-source Snowplow machine that people could build upon.
